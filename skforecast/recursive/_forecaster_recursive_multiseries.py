class ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries(ForecasterBase):
    """
    This class turns any regressor compatible with the scikit-learn API into a
    recursive autoregressive (multi-step) forecaster for multiple series.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API.
    lags : int, list, numpy ndarray, range, default `None`
        Lags used as predictors. Index starts at 1, so lag 1 is equal to t-1.
    
        - `int`: include lags from 1 to `lags` (included).
        - `list`, `1d numpy ndarray` or `range`: include only lags present in 
        `lags`, all elements must be int.
        - `None`: no lags are included as predictors. 
    window_features : object, list, default `None`
        Instance or list of instances used to create window features. Window features
        are created from the original time series and are included as predictors.
    encoding : str, None, default `'ordinal'`
        Encoding used to identify the different series. 
        
        - If `'ordinal'`, a single column is created with integer values from 0 
        to n_series - 1. 
        - If `'ordinal_category'`, a single column is created with integer 
        values from 0 to n_series - 1 and the column is transformed into 
        pandas.category dtype so that it can be used as a categorical variable. 
        - If `'onehot'`, a binary column is created for each series.
        - If None, no column is created to identify the series. Internally, the
        series are identified as an integer from 0 to n_series - 1, but no column
        is created in the training matrices.
        **Changed to 'ordinal' in version 0.14.0**
    transformer_series : transformer (preprocessor), dict, default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and 
        inverse_transform. Transformation is applied to each `series` before training 
        the forecaster. ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have 
        inverse_transform method.

        - If single transformer: it is cloned and applied to all series. 
        - If `dict` of transformers: a different transformer can be used for each series.
    transformer_exog : transformer, default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the
        forecaster. `inverse_transform` is not available when using ColumnTransformers.
    weight_func : Callable, dict, default `None`
        Function that defines the individual weights for each sample based on the
        index. For example, a function that assigns a lower weight to certain dates. 
        Ignored if `regressor` does not have the argument `sample_weight` in its 
        `fit` method. See Notes section for more details on the use of the weights.

        - If single function: it is applied to all series. 
        - If `dict` {'series_column_name' : Callable}: a different function can be
        used for each series, a weight of 1 is given to all series not present in 
        `weight_func`.
    series_weights : dict, default `None`
        Weights associated with each series {'series_column_name' : float}. It is only
        applied if the `regressor` used accepts `sample_weight` in its `fit` method. 
        See Notes section for more details on the use of the weights.

        - If a `dict` is provided, a weight of 1 is given to all series not present
        in `series_weights`.
        - If `None`, all levels have the same weight.
    differentiation : int, default `None`
        Order of differencing applied to the time series before training the forecaster.
        If `None`, no differencing is applied. The order of differentiation is the number
        of times the differencing operation is applied to a time series. Differencing
        involves computing the differences between consecutive data points in the series.
        Differentiation is reversed in the output of `predict()` and `predict_interval()`.
        **WARNING: This argument is newly introduced and requires special attention. It
        is still experimental and may undergo changes.**
    dropna_from_series : bool, default `False`
        Determine whether NaN detected in the training matrices will be dropped.

        - If `True`, drop NaNs in X_train and same rows in y_train.
        - If `False`, leave NaNs in X_train and warn the user.
        **New in version 0.12.0**
    fit_kwargs : dict, default `None`
        Additional arguments to be passed to the `fit` method of the regressor.
    forecaster_id : str, int, default `None`
        Name used as an identifier of the forecaster.

    Notes
    -----
    The weights are used to control the influence that each observation has on the
    training of the model. `ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries` accepts two types of weights. 
    If the two types of weights are indicated, they are multiplied to create the final
    weights. The resulting `sample_weight` cannot have negative values.

    - `series_weights` : controls the relative importance of each series. If a 
    series has twice as much weight as the others, the observations of that series 
    influence the training twice as much. The higher the weight of a series 
    relative to the others, the more the model will focus on trying to learn 
    that series.
    - `weight_func` : controls the relative importance of each observation 
    according to its index value. For example, a function that assigns a lower 
    weight to certain dates.

        Create training matrices from multiple time series and exogenous

        `series` and `exog`.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        series : pandas DataFrame, dict
            Training time series.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, dict, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        store_last_window : bool, list, default `True`
            Whether or not to store the last window (`last_window_`) of training data.

            - If `True`, last window is stored for all series. 
            - If `list`, last window is stored for the series present in the list.
            - If `False`, last window is not stored.

        Returns
        -------
        X_train : pandas DataFrame
            Training values (predictors).
        y_train : pandas Series
            Values of the time series related to each row of `X_train`.
        series_indexes : dict
            Dictionary with the index of each series.
        series_names_in_ : list
            Names of the series (levels) provided by the user during training.
        X_train_series_names_in_ : list
            Names of the series (levels) included in the matrix `X_train` created
            internally for training. It can be different from `series_names_in_` if
            some series are dropped during the training process because of NaNs or
            because they are not present in the training period.
        exog_names_in_ : list
            Names of the exogenous variables used during training.
        X_train_window_features_names_out_ : list
            Names of the window features included in the matrix `X_train` created
            internally for training.
        X_train_exog_names_out_ : list
            Names of the exogenous variables included in the matrix `X_train` created
            internally for training. It can be different from `exog_names_in_` if
            some exogenous variables are transformed during the training process.
        exog_dtypes_in_ : dict
            Type of each exogenous variable/s used in training. If `transformer_exog` 
            is used, the dtypes are calculated before the transformation.
        last_window_ : dict
            Last window of training data for each series. It stores the values 
            needed to predict the next `step` immediately after the training data.

        Notes
        -----
        - If `series` is a pandas DataFrame and `exog` is a pandas Series or 
        DataFrame, each exog is duplicated for each series. Exog must have the
        same index as `series` (type, length and frequency).
        - If `series` is a pandas DataFrame and `exog` is a dict of pandas Series 
        or DataFrames. Each key in `exog` must be a column in `series` and the 
        values are the exog for each series. Exog must have the same index as 
        `series` (type, length and frequency).
        - If `series` is a dict of pandas Series, `exog` must be a dict of pandas
        Series or DataFrames. The keys in `series` and `exog` must be the same.
        All series and exog must have a pandas DatetimeIndex with the same 
        frequency.

        Create the inputs needed for the first iteration of the prediction

        each iteration of the prediction process.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int
            Number of future steps predicted.
        levels : str, list, default `None`
            Time series to be predicted. If `None` all levels whose last window
            ends at the same datetime index will be predicted together.
        last_window : pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Series values used to create the predictors (lags) needed in the 
            first iteration of the prediction (t + 1).
            If `last_window = None`, the values stored in `self.last_window_` are
            used to calculate the initial predictors, and the predictions start
            right after training data.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        predict_boot : bool, default `False`
            If `True`, residuals are returned to generate bootstrapping predictions.
        use_in_sample_residuals : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, residuals from the training data are used as proxy of
            prediction error to create predictions. If `False`, out of sample 
            residuals are used. In the latter case, the user should have
            calculated and stored the residuals within the forecaster (see
            `set_out_sample_residuals()`).
        check_inputs : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, the input is checked for possible warnings and errors 
            with the `check_predict_input` function. This argument is created 
            for internal use and is not recommended to be changed.

        Returns
        -------
        last_window : pandas DataFrame
            Series values used to create the predictors needed in the first 
            iteration of the prediction (t + 1).
        exog_values_dict : dict, None
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s for each series in 
            each step. The keys are the steps and the values are numpy arrays
            where each column is an exog and each row a series (level).
        levels : list
            Names of the series (levels) to be predicted.
        prediction_index : pandas Index
            Index of the predictions.
        residuals : dict, None
            Residuals used to generate bootstrapping predictions for each level 
            in the form `{level: residuals}`. If `predict_boot = False`, 
            `residuals` is `None`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int
            Number of future steps predicted.
        levels : str, list, default `None`
            Time series to be predicted. If `None` all levels whose last window
            ends at the same datetime index will be predicted together.
        last_window : pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Series values used to create the predictors (lags) needed in the 
            first iteration of the prediction (t + 1).
            If `last_window = None`, the values stored in `self.last_window_` are
            used to calculate the initial predictors, and the predictions start
            right after training data.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, dict, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        interval : list, default `[5, 95]`
            Confidence of the prediction interval estimated. Sequence of 
            percentiles to compute, which must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
            For example, interval of 95% should be as `interval = [2.5, 97.5]`.
        n_boot : int, default `250`
            Number of bootstrapping iterations used to estimate prediction 
            intervals.
        random_state : int, default `123`
            Sets a seed to the random generator, so that boot predictions are always 
            deterministic.
        use_in_sample_residuals : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, residuals from the training data are used as proxy of
            prediction error to create predictions. If `False`, out of sample 
            residuals are used. In the latter case, the user should have
            calculated and stored the residuals within the forecaster (see
            `set_out_sample_residuals()`).
        suppress_warnings : bool, default `False`
            If `True`, skforecast warnings will be suppressed during the prediction 
            process. See skforecast.exceptions.warn_skforecast_categories for more
            information.

        Returns
        -------
        predictions : pandas DataFrame
            Values predicted by the forecaster and their estimated interval.
