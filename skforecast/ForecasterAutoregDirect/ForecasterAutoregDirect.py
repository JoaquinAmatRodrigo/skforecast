class ForecasterAutoregDirect(ForecasterBase):
    """
    This class turns any regressor compatible with the scikit-learn API into a
    autoregressive direct multi-step forecaster. A separate model is created for
    each forecast time step. See documentation for more details.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API.
    steps : int
        Maximum number of future steps the forecaster will predict when using
        method `predict()`. Since a different model is created for each step,
        this value should be defined before training.
    lags : int, list, numpy ndarray, range, default `None`
        Lags used as predictors. Index starts at 1, so lag 1 is equal to t-1.
    
        - `int`: include lags from 1 to `lags` (included).
        - `list`, `1d numpy ndarray` or `range`: include only lags present in 
        `lags`, all elements must be int.
        - `None`: no lags are included as predictors. 
    window_features : object, list, default `None`
        Instance or list of instances used to create window features. Window features
        are created from the original time series and are included as predictors.
    transformer_y : object transformer (preprocessor), default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and inverse_transform.
        ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have inverse_transform method.
        The transformation is applied to `y` before training the forecaster. 
    transformer_exog : object transformer (preprocessor), default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the
        forecaster. `inverse_transform` is not available when using ColumnTransformers.
    weight_func : Callable, default `None`
        Function that defines the individual weights for each sample based on the
        index. For example, a function that assigns a lower weight to certain dates.
        Ignored if `regressor` does not have the argument `sample_weight` in its `fit`
        method. The resulting `sample_weight` cannot have negative values.
    differentiation : int, default `None`
        Order of differencing applied to the time series before training the forecaster.
        If `None`, no differencing is applied. The order of differentiation is the number
        of times the differencing operation is applied to a time series. Differencing
        involves computing the differences between consecutive data points in the series.
        Differentiation is reversed in the output of `predict()` and `predict_interval()`.
        **WARNING: This argument is newly introduced and requires special attention. It
        is still experimental and may undergo changes.**
    fit_kwargs : dict, default `None`
        Additional arguments to be passed to the `fit` method of the regressor.
    n_jobs : int, 'auto', default `'auto'`
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If `-1`, then the number of jobs is 
        set to the number of cores. If 'auto', `n_jobs` is set using the function
        skforecast.utils.select_n_jobs_fit_forecaster.
        **New in version 0.9.0**
    forecaster_id : str, int, default `None`
        Name used as an identifier of the forecaster.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API.

        are stored in `self.regressors_`.
    regressors_ : dict
        Dictionary with regressors trained for each step. They are initialized 
        as a copy of `regressor`.
    steps : int
        Number of future steps the forecaster will predict when using method
        `predict()`. Since a different model is created for each step, this value
        should be defined before training.
    lags : numpy ndarray
        Lags used as predictors.
    max_lag : int
        Maximum lag included in `lags`.

        Maximum window size required by the window features.
    window_size : int
        The window size needed to create the predictors. It is calculated as the 
        maximum value between `max_lag` and `max_size_window_features`. If 
        differentiation is used, `window_size` is increased by n units equal to 
        the order of differentiation so that predictors can be generated correctly.
    transformer_y : object transformer (preprocessor)
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and inverse_transform.
        ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have inverse_transform method.
        The transformation is applied to `y` before training the forecaster.
    transformer_exog : object transformer (preprocessor)
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the
        forecaster. `inverse_transform` is not available when using ColumnTransformers.
    weight_func : Callable
        Function that defines the individual weights for each sample based on the
        index. For example, a function that assigns a lower weight to certain dates.
        Ignored if `regressor` does not have the argument `sample_weight` in its `fit`
        method. The resulting `sample_weight` cannot have negative values.
    differentiation : int, default `None`
        Order of differencing applied to the time series before training the forecaster.
        If `None`, no differencing is applied. The order of differentiation is the number
        of times the differencing operation is applied to a time series. Differencing
        involves computing the differences between consecutive data points in the series.
        Differentiation is reversed in the output of `predict()` and `predict_interval()`.
        **WARNING: This argument is newly introduced and requires special attention. It
        is still experimental and may undergo changes.**

        Source code of the custom function used to create weights.
    differentiation : int
        Order of differencing applied to the time series before training the 
        forecaster.
    differentiator : TimeSeriesDifferentiator
        Skforecast object used to differentiate the time series.
    last_window_ : pandas DataFrame
        This window represents the most recent data observed by the predictor
        during its training phase. It contains the values needed to predict the

        or differentiation. When `differentiation` parameter is specified, the
        dimensions of the `last_window_` are expanded as many values as the order
        of differentiation. For example, if `lags` = 7 and `differentiation` = 1,
        `last_window_` will have 8 values.
    index_type_ : type
        Type of index of the input used in training.
    index_freq_ : str
        Frequency of Index of the input used in training.

        internally for training.
    X_train_exog_names_out_ : list
        Names of the exogenous variables included in the matrix `X_train` created

        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int, list, None, default `None`
            Predict n steps. The value of `steps` must be less than or equal to the 
            value of steps defined when initializing the forecaster. Starts at 1.
        
            - If `int`: Only steps within the range of 1 to int are predicted.
            - If `list`: List of ints. Only the steps contained in the list 
            are predicted.
            - If `None`: As many steps are predicted as were defined at 
            initialization.
        last_window : pandas Series, default `None`
            Series values used to create the predictors (lags) needed to 
            predict `steps`.
            If `last_window = None`, the values stored in` self.last_window_` are
            used to calculate the initial predictors, and the predictions start
            right after training data.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        interval : list, default `[5, 95]`
            Confidence of the prediction interval estimated. Sequence of 
            percentiles to compute, which must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
            For example, interval of 95% should be as `interval = [2.5, 97.5]`.
        n_boot : int, default `500`
            Number of bootstrapping iterations used to estimate predictions.
        random_state : int, default `123`
            Sets a seed to the random generator, so that boot predictions are always 
            deterministic.
        use_in_sample_residuals : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, residuals from the training data are used as proxy of
            prediction error to create predictions. If `False`, out of sample 
            residuals are used. In the latter case, the user should have
            calculated and stored the residuals within the forecaster (see
            `set_out_sample_residuals()`).
