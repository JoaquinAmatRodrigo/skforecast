class ForecasterAutoreg(ForecasterBase):
    """
    This class turns any regressor compatible with the scikit-learn API into a
    recursive autoregressive (multi-step) forecaster.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
    lags : int, list, numpy ndarray, range, default `None`
        Lags used as predictors. Index starts at 1, so lag 1 is equal to t-1. 
    
        - `int`: include lags from 1 to `lags` (included).
        - `list`, `1d numpy ndarray` or `range`: include only lags present in 
        `lags`, all elements must be int.
        - `None`: no lags are included as predictors. 
    window_features : object, list, default `None`
        Class or list of classes used to create window features. Window features
        are created from the original time series and are included as predictors.
    transformer_y : object transformer (preprocessor), default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and inverse_transform.
        ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have inverse_transform method.
        The transformation is applied to `y` before training the forecaster. 
    transformer_exog : object transformer (preprocessor), default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the
        forecaster. `inverse_transform` is not available when using ColumnTransformers.
    weight_func : Callable, default `None`
        Function that defines the individual weights for each sample based on the
        index. For example, a function that assigns a lower weight to certain dates.
        Ignored if `regressor` does not have the argument `sample_weight` in its `fit`
        method. The resulting `sample_weight` cannot have negative values.
    differentiation : int, default `None`
        Order of differencing applied to the time series before training the forecaster.
        If `None`, no differencing is applied. The order of differentiation is the number
        of times the differencing operation is applied to a time series. Differencing
        involves computing the differences between consecutive data points in the series.
        Differentiation is reversed in the output of `predict()` and `predict_interval()`.
        **WARNING: This argument is newly introduced and requires special attention. It
        is still experimental and may undergo changes.**
        **New in version 0.10.0**
    fit_kwargs : dict, default `None`
        Additional arguments to be passed to the `fit` method of the regressor.
    binner_kwargs : dict, default `None`
        Additional arguments to pass to the `KBinsDiscretizer` used to discretize 
        the residuals into k bins according to the predicted values associated 
        with each residual. The `encode' argument is always set to 'ordinal' 
        and `dtype' to np.float64.
        **New in version 0.12.0**
    forecaster_id : str, int, default `None`
        Name used as an identifier of the forecaster.

    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API.

        The window size needed to create the predictors. It is calculated as the

        the order of differentiation so that predictors can be generated correctly.
    transformer_y : object transformer (preprocessor)
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and inverse_transform.

    differentiator : TimeSeriesDifferentiator
        Skforecast object used to differentiate the time series.

        next step immediately after the training data. These values are stored
        in the original scale of the time series before undergoing any transformations
        or differentiation. When `differentiation` parameter is specified, the
        dimensions of the `last_window_` are expanded as many values as the order

        Iterative process in which each prediction is used as a predictor
        for the next step, and bootstrapping is used to estimate prediction
        intervals. Both predictions and intervals are returned.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int
            Number of future steps predicted.
        last_window : pandas Series, default `None`
            Series values used to create the predictors (lags) needed in the 
            first iteration of the prediction (t + 1).
            If `last_window = None`, the values stored in` self.last_window_` are
            used to calculate the initial predictors, and the predictions start
            right after training data.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        interval : list, default `[5, 95]`
            Confidence of the prediction interval estimated. Sequence of 
            percentiles to compute, which must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
            For example, interval of 95% should be as `interval = [2.5, 97.5]`.
        n_boot : int, default `500`
            Number of bootstrapping iterations used to estimate predictions.
        random_state : int, default `123`
            Sets a seed to the random generator, so that boot predictions are always 
            deterministic.
        use_in_sample_residuals : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, residuals from the training data are used as proxy of
            prediction error to create predictions. If `False`, out of sample 
            residuals are used. In the latter case, the user should have
            calculated and stored the residuals within the forecaster (see
            `set_out_sample_residuals()`).
        use_binned_residuals : bool, default `False`
            If `True`, residuals used in each bootstrapping iteration are selected
            conditioning on the predicted values. If `False`, residuals are selected
            randomly without conditioning on the predicted values.

        -------
