class ForecasterAutoregMultiVariate(ForecasterBase):
    """
    This class turns any regressor compatible with the scikit-learn API into a
    autoregressive multivariate direct multi-step forecaster. A separate model 
    is created for each forecast time step. See documentation for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API.
    level : str
        Name of the time series to be predicted.
    steps : int
        Maximum number of future steps the forecaster will predict when using
        method `predict()`. Since a different model is created for each step,
        this value must be defined before training.
    lags : int, list, numpy ndarray, range, dict
        Lags used as predictors. Index starts at 1, so lag 1 is equal to t-1.

        - `int`: include lags from 1 to `lags` (included).
        - `list`, `1d numpy ndarray` or `range`: include only lags present in 
        `lags`, all elements must be int.
        - `dict`: create different lags for each series. {'series_column_name': lags}.
    transformer_series : transformer (preprocessor), dict, default `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and 
        inverse_transform. Transformation is applied to each `series` before training 
        the forecaster. ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have 
        inverse_transform method.

        - If single transformer: it is cloned and applied to all series. 
        - If `dict` of transformers: a different transformer can be used for each series.
    transformer_exog : transformer, default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the
        forecaster. `inverse_transform` is not available when using ColumnTransformers.
    weight_func : Callable, default `None`
        Function that defines the individual weights for each sample based on the
        index. For example, a function that assigns a lower weight to certain dates.
        Ignored if `regressor` does not have the argument `sample_weight` in its `fit`
        method. The resulting `sample_weight` cannot have negative values.
    fit_kwargs : dict, default `None`
        Additional arguments to be passed to the `fit` method of the regressor.
    n_jobs : int, 'auto', default `'auto'`
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If `-1`, then the number of jobs is 
        set to the number of cores. If 'auto', `n_jobs` is set using the function
        skforecast.utils.select_n_jobs_fit_forecaster.
        **New in version 0.9.0**
    forecaster_id : str, int, default `None`
        Name used as an identifier of the forecaster.

        are stored in `self.regressors_`.

        as a copy of `regressor`.
    steps : int
        Number of future steps the forecaster will predict when using method
        `predict()`. Since a different model is created for each step, this value
        should be defined before training.
    lags : numpy ndarray, dict
        Lags used as predictors.
    lags_ : dict
        Dictionary containing the lags of each series. Created from `lags` and 
        used internally.

        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and 
        inverse_transform. Transformation is applied to each `series` before training 
        the forecaster. ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have 
        inverse_transform method.

        - If single transformer: it is cloned and applied to all series. 
        - If `dict` of transformers: a different transformer can be used for each series.
    transformer_series_ : dict

        objects in `transformer_series` and is used internally to avoid overwriting.
    transformer_exog : transformer
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the

        is not `None`, residuals are stored in the transformed scale.
    out_sample_residuals_ : dict
        Residuals of the models when predicting non training data. Only stored
        up to 1000 values per model in the form `{step: residuals}`. If `transformer_series`

        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int, list, None, default `None`
            Predict n steps. The value of `steps` must be less than or equal to the 
            value of steps defined when initializing the forecaster. Starts at 1.
        
            - If `int`: Only steps within the range of 1 to int are predicted.
            - If `list`: List of ints. Only the steps contained in the list 
            are predicted.
            - If `None`: As many steps are predicted as were defined at 
            initialization.
        last_window : pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Series values used to create the predictors (lags) needed to 
            predict `steps`.
            If `last_window = None`, the values stored in` self.last_window_` are
            used to calculate the initial predictors, and the predictions start
            right after training data.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        interval : list, default `[5, 95]`
            Confidence of the prediction interval estimated. Sequence of 
            percentiles to compute, which must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
            For example, interval of 95% should be as `interval = [2.5, 97.5]`.
        n_boot : int, default `250`
            Number of bootstrapping iterations used to estimate predictions.
        random_state : int, default `123`
            Sets a seed to the random generator, so that boot predictions are always 
            deterministic.
        use_in_sample_residuals : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, residuals from the training data are used as proxy of
            prediction error to create predictions. If `False`, out of sample 
            residuals are used. In the latter case, the user should have
            calculated and stored the residuals within the forecaster (see
            `set_out_sample_residuals()`).
        suppress_warnings : bool, default `False`
            If `True`, skforecast warnings will be suppressed during the prediction 
            process. See skforecast.exceptions.warn_skforecast_categories for more
            information.

        predictions : pandas DataFrame
            Values predicted by the forecaster and their estimated interval.
