    "Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for several reasons: to simplify models to make them easier to interpret, to reduce training time, to avoid the curse of dimensionality, to improve generalization by reducing overfitting (formally, variance reduction), and others.\n",

    "**Recursive feature elimination**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination ([RFE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html)) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features, and the importance of each feature is obtained either by a specific attribute (such as `coef_`, `feature_importances_`) or by a `callable`. Then, the least important features are pruned from the current set of features. This procedure is repeated recursively on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached. [RFECV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html#sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV) performs RFE in a cross-validation loop to find the optimal number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Feature Selection ([SFS](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html)) can be either forward or backward, with the `direction` parameter controlling whether forward or backward SFS is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Forward-SFS** is a greedy procedure that iteratively finds the best new feature to add to the set of selected features. It starts with zero features and finds the one that maximizes a cross-validated score when an estimator is trained on that single feature. Once this first feature is selected, the procedure is repeated, adding one new feature to the set of selected features. The procedure stops when the desired number of selected features is reached, as determined by the `n_features_to_select` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Backward-SFS** follows the same idea, but works in the opposite direction. Instead of starting with no features and greedily adding features, it starts with all features and greedily removes features from the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, forward and backward selection do not produce equivalent results. Also, one can be much faster than the other depending on the requested number of selected features: if we have 10 features and ask for 7 selected features, forward selection would need to perform 7 iterations while backward selection would only need to perform 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "SFS differs does not require the underlying model to expose a `coef_` or `feature_importances_` attribute. However, it may be slower compared to the other approaches, considering that more models have to be evaluated. For example in backward selection, the iteration going from $m$ features to $m - 1$ features using k-fold cross-validation requires fitting $m * k$ models to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in backward selection, the iteration going from $n$ features to $n - m$ features using k-fold cross-validation requires fitting $m * k$ models to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature selection based on threshold (SelectFromModel)**\n",
    "\n",
    "[SelectFromModel](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html) can be used along with any estimator that has a `coef_` or `feature_importances_` attribute after fitting. Features are considered unimportant and removed, if the corresponding `coef_` or `feature_importances_` values are below the given `threshold` parameter. In addition to specifying the `threshold` numerically, there are built-in heuristics for finding a threshold using a string argument. Available heuristics are \"mean\", \"median\" and float multiples of these, such as \"0.1\\*mean\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is very fast compared to the others because it does not require any additional model training. However, it does not evaluate the impact of feature removal on the model. It is often used for an initial selection before applying another more computationally expensive feature selection method."
